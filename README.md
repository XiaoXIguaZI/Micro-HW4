In order to fully implement the deployment requirements of the Central Financial Work Conference on promoting the work of "credit loans" and continuously deepen the application of credit information sharing to promote the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises, on December 7th, the Finance Department of the National Development and Reform Commission held a national on-site meeting in Chengdu, Sichuan Province to comprehensively improve the quality and efficiency of "credit loans" services and promote the high-quality development of inclusive finance. The main responsible personnel of the Finance and Economics Department attended the meeting and delivered a speech.

At the meeting, 11 places including Hebei Province, Shanghai City, Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, Chongqing City, Yunnan Province, Sichuan Province, Dalian City, Hefei City, Guangzhou City, and Chengdu City showcased and exchanged ideas on the measures and achievements of promoting "credit loans". Three banks, including Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and Postal Savings Bank of China, gave typical speeches on the exploration and practice of "credit loans" work. The person in charge of the Inclusive Finance Department of the State Administration for Financial Supervision and Administration gave a speech on better leveraging the role of credit information to support the development of inclusive finance.

The meeting emphasized that the "Xinyi Loan" model is an effective path to develop inclusive finance and promote financial services for the real economy. It is an important component of the modern financial system with Chinese characteristics and a concrete manifestation of the firm commitment to the development of Chinese characteristic finance. It fully reflects the political and people-oriented nature of financial work.

The meeting pointed out that in recent years, various regions and relevant financial institutions have achieved positive results in promoting the "Xinyi Loan" work, mainly in the sharing of credit information, the construction of a national integrated financing credit service platform network, practical cooperation with banking institutions, and local innovation practices, achieving important breakthroughs in all aspects.

The meeting requires that the next step is to comprehensively improve the quality and efficiency of "Xinyi Loan" services and promote the high-quality development of inclusive finance. Firstly, the platform needs to be integrated to better leverage the data aggregation effect. The second is to develop information to ensure the accuracy, effectiveness, and availability of data. The third is to deepen cooperation, and the platform and financial institutions should further strengthen the integration of service functions, achieving data, model, and system connectivity. The fourth is to expand the functions and further deepen the application of "platform+policy", "platform+guarantee", and "platform+risk control" functions. The fifth is to ensure security and effectively strengthen information security and protection of subject rights and interests.

Leaders from various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, as well as leading departments for social credit system construction in some cities, China Development Bank, Export Import Bank of China, Agricultural Development Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications, Postal Savings Bank of China, China Minsheng Bank, Finance Department of the National Development and Reform Commission, National Data Bureau Preparatory Group Three, and National Public Credit Information Center attended the meeting.
