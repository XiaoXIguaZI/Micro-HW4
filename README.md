News from Wuhan: As of 18:00 on July 11th, 2020, the water level at the gauge station in Wuhan is 28.44 meters. Ding Xinhong, the head of the flood control expert group at the Wuhan Flood Control Office, stated that currently, the water level of the Yangtze River is still rising, and it is expected to reach 29.2 meters around the 16th of July. This water level will rank third in the hydrological records history of Wuhan, only surpassed by the levels in 1954 (29.73 meters) and 1998 (29.43 meters).

Academician Wang Hao once pointed out, "The storage coefficient, which represents the ratio of a country's reservoir storage capacity to the river runoff, is typically above 0.9 in European countries, 0.66 in the United States, while in China, it is currently below 0.3." The direct consequence of insufficient reservoir storage capacity is that in the face of major floods, developed countries can retain water in reservoirs, whereas China has to exert all efforts in flood control and emergency response, aiming to divert floodwaters to the sea for safety. However, during periods of drought, China also faces the dilemma of inadequate water supply.

"Building a resilient disaster prevention and reduction system" is one of the six main themes of the 18th World Water Resources Conference. Against the backdrop of global climate change, the water safety risks of extreme heavy rainfall triggering floods continue to intensify. What efforts has the water resources sector made in constructing a resilient flood defense system? What are the next steps in their plans?

On September 6th, the Water Resources Ministry held a press conference on the relevant situation of the 18th World Water Resources Conference. When asked by The Paper journalist, Liu Weiping, the Deputy Minister of Water Resources, stated that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party has led the people nationwide in carrying out large-scale water conservancy projects, continuously solidifying the foundation for flood prevention and disaster reduction.

In terms of defense engineering systems, the nation has completed more than 98,000 reservoirs, represented by the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River and Xiaolangdi on the Yellow River. Additionally, various types of river embankments span over 430,000 kilometers. Ninety-eight national flood storage and detention areas with a total volume of 108 billion cubic meters have been established, forming a comprehensive basin flood control engineering system consisting mainly of reservoirs, rivers, embankments, and flood storage areas. Currently, major rivers in China have the capacity to defend against the largest floods since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

According to Liu Weiping, during the 2022 flood season, 4,151 large and medium-sized reservoirs were put into operation, storing and controlling floodwaters totaling 92.5 billion cubic meters. This prevented flooding in 1,649 towns, saved 15.3 million acres of farmland from inundation, and avoided the relocation of 6.9 million people.

This year, a catastrophic flood occurred in the Haihe River Basin, with 22 rivers experiencing floods exceeding the warning level and eight rivers reaching their highest levels ever recorded. To respond to this flood, the water resources sector strategically utilized 84 large and medium-sized reservoirs in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to control 2.85 billion cubic meters of floodwaters. Key hubs like Beiguan and Lugou Bridge were used to release floodwaters in an orderly manner, and eight flood storage areas were activated to store and control floods, with a maximum storage capacity of 25.3 billion cubic meters. Through scientific and precise scheduling, 24 towns and 7.51 million acres of farmland were spared from flooding, and the relocation of 4.623 million people was avoided. This showcased the comprehensive disaster reduction benefits of the basin flood control engineering system, minimizing the impact and losses caused by floods.

Regarding non-engineering defense systems, monitoring, forecasting, and warning capabilities have significantly improved. The number of water monitoring stations across the country has increased from over 70,000 in 2012 to the current 120,000. The data collection frequency has been reduced from 30 minutes to 15 minutes, and the accuracy of flood forecasts for major rivers in the north and south has increased to over 90% and 70%, respectively. Flood monitoring and early warning platforms have been established in 2,076 counties with disaster prevention tasks.

During the defense against the "23Â·7" catastrophic flood in the Haihe River Basin, over 1.42 million rainwater monitoring reports were submitted, 2,035 flood forecasts were issued, and more than 90 river flood warnings were released to the public. The provinces and municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan issued over 11,900 county-level mountain flood disaster warnings, leading to the evacuation of 139,800 people and effectively reducing casualties.

Liu Weiping stated that in the next steps, the Water Resources Ministry will collaborate with relevant departments and local authorities to expedite the improvement of basin flood control engineering systems. This includes advancing the construction of flood control-regulating reservoirs, embankments, and facilities for flood storage areas, strengthening the governance of main rivers, advancing the control of small and medium-sized rivers and mountain torrents, and accelerating the construction of urban flood control and drainage projects.

Simultaneously, efforts will be made to accelerate the establishment of a three-tier defense system for rainwater monitoring, forecasting, and warning, utilizing meteorological satellites, rain-measuring radars, rainfall stations, and hydrological stations. The development of a digital twin basin and flood forecasting, warning, simulation, and contingency planning capabilities will be promoted, and the institutional mechanisms and legal frameworks will be improved. This includes enhancing the management of flood storage areas and spatial control of river channels, comprehensively upgrading the capabilities for water and drought disaster defense.

The 18th World Water Resources Conference will be held from September 11 to 15 in Beijing. This marks the first time that China hosts the World Water Resources Conference.

The theme of this conference is "Water and All: Harmonious Coexistence between People and Nature." It consists of six sub-themes: "The Nexus of 'Water Resources, Population, Economy, and Ecology' in a Changing Environment," "Improving Water Use Efficiency and Benefits for Water Public Services," "Building a Resilient Disaster Prevention and Reduction System," "Enhancing the Quality and Stability of Water Ecosystems," "Advancing Sustainable Smart Water Infrastructure Construction," and "Innovations in Water Governance and Management."
